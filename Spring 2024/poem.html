            <li>I didn't think that I would make it</li>
            <li>I was sinking</li>
            <li>And the shame came like a wave</li>
            <li>I just knew that I was too far gone</li>
            <li>Then you showed up</li>

        <h3><hr>[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]</h3>
        (Sing on time God)
        On time God,<br>You love the impossible
        On time God,<br>You love doing miracles
        
        <h4>[Verse 2: Chandler Moore]</h4>
        Oh, come on
        I see it all now (I see it all now)
        How Your hand (How Your hand was always working)
        Come on (Even in doubt)
        You were faithful (You were faithful, never failing)
        Even when I thought (Even when I thought)
        I really thought the darkness won (The darkness won)
        You showed up, oh</p>
