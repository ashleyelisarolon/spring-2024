    <h1>Intervention Reflection</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Reddit is a discussion website where users can post and discuss links, images, and videos on various topics, including news, entertainment, technology, and more.<br>
        What interests me about Reddit is its unique upvoting and downvoting system, allowing users to vote on the quality of content, making it easier to find the most valuable and<br>
        engaging content. My intervention was a collaborative mural with the theme of "Metamorphosis." The aim is to encourage artists to interpret the theme uniquely while<br>
        suggesting they incorporate vibrating greens. The top 25 most upvoted comments would then be featured in the collaborative mural. It was officially established on March<br>
        10th, 2024. I am still waiting to receive feedback on this intervention. It was expected because it was done recently, and Reddit has many different subreddits; therefore, it<br>
        could take a while before it gets any attention. If I had more time to expand on my intervention, I would explore different ways to promote it. One approach would be to reach<br>
        out to art-focused subreddits and communities to encourage participation and engagement with the project. I could also partner with other artists or organizations to help<br>
        spread the word and attract a wider audience.</p>
